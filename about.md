Hi -- I'm Emmett. This blog is made up of the thoughts of a student interested in information security.

I've given a few talks at [r00tz](https://r00tz.org), and am an eCPPT + eJPT. Whenever I'm not hacking, a pencil is usually in my hands: writing is another hobby of mine.

I can be contacted through my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/p0wnyb0y).

Thanks for reading.
